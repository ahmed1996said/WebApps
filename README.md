This repository contains different web applications I developed while self-learning new concepts and tools in Web Development. The Web Apps in this directory include:
  -/stocks : a stock trading simulator using real-time stock information.
  -/books  : an online book reviewing page of over 5,000 books where users can leave reviews and ratings. (TO BE UPLOADED)
  -/chats  : an online chatroom where users can create channels and chat with each other in groups (similar to Slack). (TO BE UPLOADED)
