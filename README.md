# Overview

This repository contains different web applications I developed while self-learning new concepts and tools in Web Development. The Web Apps in this directory include:
  -  :chart_with_upwards_trend: /stocks  : a stock trading simulator using real-time stock information.
  - :book: /books  : an online book reviewing page of over 4,000 books where users can leave reviews and ratings.
  - :speech_balloon: /chats  : an online chatroom where users can create channels and chat with each other in groups (similar to Slack).
