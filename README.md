# Overview

This repository contains different web applications I developed while self-learning new concepts and tools in Web Development. The Web Apps in this directory include:

  -  :chart_with_upwards_trend: /stocks  :  a stock trading simulator using real-time stock information.
  - :book: /books   :  an online book reviewing page of over 4,000 books where users can leave reviews and ratings.
  - :speech_balloon: /chats   :  an online chatroom where users can create channels and chat with each other in groups (similar to Slack). 


# Development
I developed these Web Applications with HTML/CSS and Javascript and Bootstrap on the client side, and Python programming for the server end. The applications were developed with different complexities since this is a learning project. But generally, most were developed using Flask microframework, and the more recent projects using Django.
